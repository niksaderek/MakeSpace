## What is MakeSpace?

MakeSpace helps you reclaim valuable storage space by safely removing temporary files, browser caches, and other digital clutter that builds up over time.

**Safe, Simple, Free** - No installation required.

---

## How to Use

1. **Download** `MakeSpace_v2.8.exe`
2. **Right-click** the file and select **"Run as administrator"**
3. **Read the safety warning** and click **Yes** to continue
4. **Click "Scan"** to find cleanup opportunities
5. **Review the results** - Green items are safe, Orange/Red need review
6. **Click "Clean Selected Items"** to free up space

That's it! The app will show you how much space you've freed.

## What Gets Cleaned?

### Automatically Selected (Green - Safe)
- Temporary files from Windows and your apps
- Browser caches (Chrome, Edge) - makes your browser download images again
- Old Windows Update files (already installed)
- Developer tool caches (if you're a developer)
- GPU shader caches (games will rebuild these)

### You Choose (Orange/Red - Review First)
- Unknown cache folders automatically detected
- Large files you might want to keep

---

## Important Things to Know

### Files Are Permanently Deleted
- They do **NOT** go to the Recycle Bin
- You **CANNOT** recover them after cleaning
- Only clean items you're sure about

### What Happens After Cleaning
- ✅ You'll have more disk space
- ⚠️ Websites may load slightly slower the first time (browser re-downloads images)
- ⚠️ Some websites might log you out
- ⚠️ Apps may need to re-download data

### Your Files Are Protected
These folders are **automatically blocked** from deletion:
- Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music, Downloads
- All important Windows system folders
- Your personal files and settings

---

## Tips

- **Run MakeSpace once a month** to keep your system clean
- **Close all programs** before cleaning for best results
- **When in doubt, uncheck it** - it's better to be safe
- **Hover over items** to see detailed information

## Need Help?

### "Not Running as Administrator"
Right-click MakeSpace and select **"Run as administrator"**

### Some Files Won't Delete
This is normal - close all programs and try again

### Browser Cache Keeps Coming Back
This is expected - browsers recreate cache as you use them

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Administrator rights recommended
